    Neesarg:
------------------
Is the Button Down method in: InputController
m_xboxButtonState should be private
	theGame.cpp

Game: Filter->General
	Catagories: Entities

Get rid of Goblins & Polygon2.

Variables:
	Bool: isWordFirst Ex: Bool m_isKeyPressed
	use m_ in theApp..

Delete unsued code!

#include Engine/../ThirdParty -> #include ThirdParty
Re organize #includes: Engines first and Game second

All Render() should be const.

Render() can not change the gamestate. Check it in GameStates Transition

Render_Defeat .. and all have DrawInTextBox( .., .. ,.., .. );
	make it to a new simple function with one or two arguments

Double linebreak or comment for class & struct seperation

const std::string& str
Make methods const; removing the const from argument is not right.

Why just Player can ResetHealth() ?, Actor or Entity should have that!

Make a new Folder for MapGenSteps

remove enum Faction -> We'll replace with string

EntityDefinition:


ActorDefinition: if( it != s_definition.end() ) { ERROR("Two Definitions") }

To make a warning an error.. Write this in EngineCommon:
#pragma warning ( error : 4458 );
	        ( disable : XXXX );


for() {
	break;
	continue; }

explicit Vector2( from IntVec2 );

virtual ~Entity();
