Deep Learning:
	As I know myself, I'm not at that position where I can constantly code for a majority of the day. I like to
take time, but code as much correctly/structurally as I can. On this assignment, because of Chillennium and Cold
I lost some days. End result was me trying to make things work without much of before-thinking/planning, which made 
my code messy, which made me frustrated working on that same messy code.
    What I learned, Never code bad even though you are doing it hastily. The same bad code will take more time
in future coding sessions.
